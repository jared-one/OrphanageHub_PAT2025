# OrphanageHub Project - Fix Summary
Date: September 5, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Connection Test Query
**Problem**: The connection test query "SELECT 1" was not valid for UCanAccess/HSQLDB driver
**Solution**: Changed the test query to "VALUES(1)" which is the correct syntax for HSQLDB
**File Modified**: `/src/main/java/com/orphanagehub/dao/DatabaseManager.java` (line 70)

### 2. Table Name Mismatch
**Problem**: OrphanageDAO was using incorrect table name "Orphanages" instead of "TblOrphanages"
**Solution**: Updated all SQL queries to use the correct table name "TblOrphanages"
**File Modified**: `/src/main/java/com/orphanagehub/dao/OrphanageDAO.java` (lines 19, 40, 60, 78, 95)

### 3. Database Initialization During Panel Construction
**Problem**: AdminDashboardPanel was trying to fetch data during initialization causing failures
**Solution**: Deferred data loading using SwingUtilities.invokeLater() and added proper error handling
**File Modified**: `/src/main/java/com/orphanagehub/gui/AdminDashboardPanel.java` (lines 60-68)

## Current Status
✅ Build succeeds without errors (only warnings remain)
✅ Application starts successfully
✅ Database connection pool initializes properly
✅ GUI loads without crashes
✅ Error handling is in place for database failures

## Build and Run Commands
```bash
# Set Java environment
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java

# Build the project
make build

# Run the application
make run

# Alternative direct run
./mvnw exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.orphanagehub.gui.OrphanageHubApp
```

## Remaining Warnings (Non-critical)
- Serialization warnings for GUI panels (standard Swing issue)
- 'this' escape warnings (initialization pattern issue, not critical)
- Maven shade plugin resource overlap warnings (expected with multiple JARs)

## Database Tables Confirmed
- TblUsers (6 columns)
- TblOrphanages (8 columns)  
- TblResourceRequests (10 columns)

All critical issues have been resolved and the application runs successfully.
